To install the system, download the zip file called "src.zip" 
from CMS. The system was constructed with the basic version of 
OCaml initially installed for this class, so downloading any 
additional OPAM packages won't be needed. 

Since the last milestone, we created a Makefile. We are still ironing out
some issues, but the basic functionality of playing the game is there. 

Run "make play" to play our boggle game. At the time of submission, only 
the 4x4 size board words, so when queried, please return 4 as the board 
dimension (that functionality should be working by demo.)
